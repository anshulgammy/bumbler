# ELK Stack Dockerized implementation for Centralized Logging

# I have specified a custom network, 'elk', for all the services defined in this docker-compose file.
# If we don't specify the network, then by default Compose sets up a single network for your app.
# Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network,
# and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the 'container' name.
# If we define a custom network, like the way I did in this demo, each service can specify what networks
# to connect to with the service-level networks key, which is a list of names referencing entries under the top-level networks key.

# Links allow you to define extra aliases by which a service is reachable from another service.
# They are not required to enable services to communicate - by default, any service can reach any other
# service at that serviceâ€™s name.

# Using environment in docker-compose, we can supply the key-value pair for environment variables
# which will be passed to the container.

# Using the instructions in this docker-compose file, Images will be built from the Dockerfile present at the
# mentioned path.

# Used -f to specify name and path of one or more Compose files. I have used the -f flag, under command section,
# to specify the location of additional Compose configuration file for logstash.

# In this example, Kibana and Logstash are having their dedicated configuration files, which are being
# supplied to the container via this compose file.
